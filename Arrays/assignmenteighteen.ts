//Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
// Create an array of countries
const countries: string[] = ["USA", "Canada", "France", "Japan", "Australia"];
// Print the list of countries
console.log("List of Countries:", countries);
